Code for the BSIP course.

The folders contain implementations for QRS detection on ECG signals and Canny detector for CT scans + 3D contour reconstruction.
See [3D Canny organ contour detection README](canny_ct/README.md) and [Ding. et al. QRS detection implementation](qrs_detection/README.md) for more details. 

The Canny project includes a [demo visualization script](canny_ct/vis.py) with precomputed pointcloud.
